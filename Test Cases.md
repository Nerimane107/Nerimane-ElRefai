# First Part: Test Design
## Testing Scenarios :

* When setting up a reminder for a scheduled time, You will receive a notification at the specified time titeled with the name of the reminder and the time.
* When trying to set up a reminder for a time in the past (It is 12:15 pm and you want to set a reminder for today at 11:30 am), The application won't allow it.
* When you share your to do list with your team, You can all see the updates and edits added to the list.
* Verify that you can use voice commands to add tasks and reminders to your to-list using siri.
* Verify that you can easily add attachements and files to your tasks.
*  Mark a task as completed and shake your device. The completed task should be removed from your to do list.
*  Set up a task in your to do list for Today. If you drag and drop it to to tomorrow's list it should be moved.
*  When you swipe , or click on the checkbox next to the task, it is marked as complete.
*  You can tag a task as a priority and it will be at the top of the list.
*  You can filter the tasks in a list using tags like "Priority". You should only see the tagged tasks in your list.
