# First Part: Test Design
## Testing Scenarios :

* When setting up a reminder for a scheduled time, You will receive a notification at the specified time titeled with the name of the reminder and the time : **Priority num 1**
* When trying to set up a reminder for a time in the past (It is 12:15 pm and you want to set a reminder for today at 11:30 am), The application won't allow it. **Priority num 2**
* When you share your to do list or grocery list with your team, You can all see the updates and edits added to the list. You can also edit yourself. **Priority num 6**
* Verify that you can use voice commands to add tasks and reminders to your to-list using siri. **Priority num 10**
* Verify that you can easily add attachements and files to your tasks. **Priority num 9**
