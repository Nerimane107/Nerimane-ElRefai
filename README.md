Hello,
Here I will explain everything related to the structure of my files.
* the folder Part1&2 containes the file TestCases.md which contains the answers to Part 1 and 2 of the task ( the test scenarios and the bugs).
* the folder SeleniumProject contains the code which is automation testing for the login feature. it also containes TestCases.md file which has all the test cases designed for this feature.
* I used selenium and java since it wasn't specified in the task what to use specifically, so I thought I'd learn something new (selenium) while sticking too my comfort zone (java).
* I'm using Edge WebDriver and Junit 5. The tests will be found in in LoginTests.
* Please make sure to include all jar files in the configure Build Path to ensure that everything works perfectly.

  Thank you.
